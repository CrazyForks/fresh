# Customization & Themes

*February 11, 2026*

Make Fresh your own — themes, settings, and keybindings all have dedicated visual editors.

## Select Theme

Browse and apply color themes from the command palette. Fresh ships with several built-in themes. Install more via the package manager (`Ctrl+P` → "Packages"), or drop `.json` theme files into `~/.config/fresh/themes/`.

</div>

## Settings UI

A full graphical settings editor — no need to hand-edit JSON. Browse categories, search with `/` to filter, and edit values with proper controls for each type.

</div>

## Keybinding Editor

A full-featured modal for customizing every key binding. Search with `/`, filter by context or source, add new bindings with conflict detection, and delete built-in defaults.
