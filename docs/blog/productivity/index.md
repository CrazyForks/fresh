# Productivity Features

*February 11, 2026*

Beyond text editing — the tools that make Fresh a complete development environment in your terminal.

## Command Palette

**Ctrl+P** opens the unified command palette. Type to fuzzy-find files, prefix with `>` for commands, `#` for open buffers, `:` for go-to-line. Tab completion and hints guide you through.

## Split View

Split the editor horizontally or vertically. Each pane has its own tab bar, cursor, and scroll position. Navigate between panes with **Ctrl+K**.

## File Explorer

**Ctrl+E** toggles a sidebar file tree. Navigate with arrow keys, expand directories with Enter, and type to fuzzy-filter. Git status indicators show modified and untracked files.

## Integrated Terminal

Open a terminal split inside the editor. Supports scrollback history, keyboard capture mode (F9), mouse forwarding, and session persistence across restarts.
